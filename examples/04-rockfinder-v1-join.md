This example shows how two RockFinders can be joined. It lists all cats and dogs and their owners. This is a single page reference because this is the simpler join. Page reference fields that hold multiple page references can also be joined but need custom SQL (group by, concat, etc).

The grid shows two unnecessary columns (owner and owner_id). Both fields are necessary for the join and could be hidden via JS (see next example).
