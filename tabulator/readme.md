# Tabulator

Library used: Tabulator v4.7.2 (http://tabulator.info/docs/4.2)

## Possible Contributions (TODOs)

* Add support for different CSS themes, maybe even with LESS support using RockLESS. At the moment it uses the simple theme.
* Fix hightlight.js scrollbar bug (in RockSandbox.css, see https://i.imgur.com/CnOEIzJ.png)
